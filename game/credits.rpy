###To simplify the credits, all you need is to edit these variables
###credits_thanks1 and thanks2 are reserved for special positions, such as programmer, or thanks.
###if you leave them as None, they'll simply won't appear in the credits
###an example would be:
### $credits_header1 = "Programming:"
### $credits_thanks1 = "Hackerman"
init:
    $ credits_thanks = "Thank you for playing!"
    $ credits_writer = "Waffle"
    $ credits_artist = "Wanaca"
    $ credits_bg_artist = "Fatelinealpha\nMoruno Creative"
    $ credits_music = "Zack Parrish"
    #$ credits_gui = "Badriel"
    $ credits_production = "Exilim"
    $ credits_header1 = None
    $ credits_thanks1 = "Thank you for playing!"
    $ credits_header2 = None
    $ credits_thanks2 = None
    $ credits_header3 = None
    $ credits_thanks3 = None
